    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A goth girl once arrived to a picnic with 24 of those. They were delicious, if you are vegan you can replace the sausage with whatever, or just use beans.</p>
    <h3>Dry ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 flour tortillas</li>
        <li>3 potatoes (any type)</li>
        <li>1 liter of refried beans</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><em>(Optional)</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes, cut them in half, and use a grater to slice them into thin pieces.</li>
        <li>Cut the sausages into quarters or smaller pieces, depending on how large you want them.</li>
        <li>Start making the chimichangas by spreading a layer of beans on a tortilla. Add the potato slices and sausage pieces along the edge (adjust the amount based on how stuffed you want them).</li>
        <li>Once you have all the chimichangas prepared (if you don't make all 24 or make extras, you can use toothpicks to keep them closed while frying).</li>
        <li>In a skillet, pour enough oil to reach about 1/4 to 1/2 inch depth. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the chimichangas.</li>
        <li>Fry them for approximately 2 minutes on one side, then flip them to fry the other side until they turn golden brown. Remove from the oil and place on a plate or container lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil.</li>
        <li>Repeat the frying process until all the chimichangas are cooked. Serve as desired (if you want to add cheese, do so when adding the potatoes and sausage to the tortilla).</li>
    </ol>
